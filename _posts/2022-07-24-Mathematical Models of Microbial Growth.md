Marine microbes are some of the most numerous organisms in the world. Although you may have never seen or though about them, they make our planet survivable in many ways (not the least of which is producing 50% of the atmospheric oxygen we breathe). Despite being so numerous and critical to life on our planet, there are major gaps in our understanding of how these tiny organisms are shaped by their environment. 

Under a fellowship with NASA Space Grant, I studied just how temperature impacts these organisms and make our planet habitable. In this project, by creating mathematical models of microbial growth and size as a function of temperatures, I provided a small piece of NASA's large numerical models that work to model and predict our own planetary function.

__Objective__:

Measure and mathematically model the growth and cellular size traits of microbial organisms.
