When I see my statistical or machine learning models in action it greatly pleases me. Recently, I had some of my survival (aka time to event) modeling work published in a medical journal, which was a pleasure. Of course, being a medical journal, I was limited to the detail with which I could discuss the statistical aspects. In this post, I am going to discuss survival modeling, the frequently abused cox survival model, and alternative non-proportional hazards models that can overcome the restrictive assumptions of the cox model. I will finish with a description of the published survival models I used to predict COVID patient outcome.

## What is survival modeling?

Surivival models are used for what we call time to event data. That is we use these models to predict when an event will occur and the probability of an event occuring within that period of time. Many of the statistical survival models also give us a tool to study the factors that can influence time to event.
