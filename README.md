# Personal Blog Site

   This is the source code for my personal site hosted on Github pages with the domain name www.jacobstrock.com

   The theme for this site is a modified version of minimal-mistakes which I have forked and adapted. particularly, adding Latex capability which will be necessary to add mathematical explaination.
