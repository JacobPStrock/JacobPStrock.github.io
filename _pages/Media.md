__Media__:

While much of my work and research is confidential by nature, some projects which were funded through public grants were not, and some applications in private industry have been publicly presented. Some of these resulted in media pieces for public consumption which you can find below.

- See me perform a live demo, integrating predictive models into Fabscape as a plugin in a Semiconductor Digest webinar [here](https://www.semiconductor-digest.com/fabscape-webinar-march-2023/)

- I presented at SPIE (Society of Photographic Instrumentation Engineers) Advanced Lithography and Patterning about some of my recent work with Gigaphoton to bring machine learning to lithography and semiconductor manufacturing. See the abstract and details [here](https://spie.org/advanced-lithography/presentation/The-development-of-a-machine-learning-based-excimer-laser-performance/12496-101)

- Currently, I work on machine learning solutions for lithography in semiconductor manufacturing. You can hear me present about the Fabscape platform and the unique data solutions it provides for semiconductor manufacturing [here](https://www.semiconductor-digest.com/fabscape-webinar-october-2022/)

- You can read about the project I was a part of developing predictive models for COVID patient outcome [here](https://nebigdatahub.org/critcovidview/). This was a large team effort, where I served in a consulting role for data science and machine learning.

- On a research expedition to the Northwest Passage, I served as the biology team lead, using imaging equipment and image analysis and other machine learning tools to study the distribution of microbial communities, and the environmental factors driving their distribution and function.

- On the same research expedition, Dr. Alessandra D'Angelo and I identified the presence of microscopic plastics deep in the otherwise apparently pristine landscape. Read about it [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-environment-arctic-plastic-idUSKCN1V41V2), [here](https://www.indiatimes.com/technology/science-and-future/plastic-falls-as-snow-in-the-arctic-pollutes-deep-under-ice-even-with-no-humans-around-373662.html), [here](https://e360.yale.edu/features/a-northwest-passage-journey-finds-little-ice-and-big-changes). Or [hear a podcast about the discovery](https://zerowastecountdown.podbean.com/e/65-plastic-in-the-arctic/).

- As an undergraduate, funded by the Robert Bean Scholarship, I worked with Dr. Richard Brill to study the physiology of elasmoranchs (sharks), to study how these ancient creatures may be important model organisms to our own medical research due to their shared use of gasotransmitters to regulate blood vessels. The research was written about [here](https://www.delmarvanow.com/story/life/outdoors/2015/07/10/sandbar-shark-fishing/29976803/)
