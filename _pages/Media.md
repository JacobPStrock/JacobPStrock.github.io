__Media__:

While much of my work and research is confidential by nature, some projects which were funded through public grants were not. Some of these resulted in media pieces for public consumption which you can find below.

- You can read about the project I was a part of developing predictive models for COVID patient outcome [here](https://nebigdatahub.org/critcovidview/). This was a large team effort, where I served in a consulting role for data science and machine learning.

- On a research expedition to the Northwest Passage, I served as the biology team lead, using imaging equipment and image analysis and other machine learning tools to study the distribution of microbial communities, and the environmental factors driving their distribution and function.

- On the same research expedition, Dr. Alessandra D'Angelo and I identified the presence of microscopic plastics deep in the otherwise apparently pristine landscape. Read about it [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-environment-arctic-plastic-idUSKCN1V41V2), [here](https://www.indiatimes.com/technology/science-and-future/plastic-falls-as-snow-in-the-arctic-pollutes-deep-under-ice-even-with-no-humans-around-373662.html), [here](https://e360.yale.edu/features/a-northwest-passage-journey-finds-little-ice-and-big-changes). Or [hear a podcast about the discovery](https://zerowastecountdown.podbean.com/e/65-plastic-in-the-arctic/).

- As an undergraduate, funded by the Robert Bean Scholarship, I worked with Dr. Richard Brill to study the physiology of elasmoranchs (sharks), to study how these ancient creatures may be important model organisms to our own medical research due to their shared use of gasotransmitters to regulate blood vessels. The research was written about [here](https://www.delmarvanow.com/story/life/outdoors/2015/07/10/sandbar-shark-fishing/29976803/)
