__About Me__:

_"The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone’s backyard.”_
    _-John Tukey_

In my time as a statistician to data scientist I have had the privelage to work on a great number of topics including excimer laser lithography, medical studies of COVID patients and pharmaceutical regimes, risk analysis of premature birth, long-term environmental monitoring, oceanographic exploration, behavioral studies of fish, and the development of field techniques for the detection of fraudulent pharmaceutical drugs. Plainly, to find meaning in data is what drives me. Each data set and project comes with its own unique challenges. Every day I have the joy of solving puzzles with machine learning and statistics. 

While I began my education as a scientist, inevitably, the data components of research are what continued to draw me. Inevitably, I transformed from research scientist to data scientist, earning my [masters degree in statistics](https://digitalcommons.uri.edu/theses/1926/) developing new forecasting methods, as well as gaining some [other professional certifications](https://coursera.org/share/1e1324a784a999c740d91e983d8d6e36) to expand my knowledge.

*My research career has taken me around the globe to solve unique problems. Here I am on a research expedition through the Northwest Passage*

While much of my work is confidential by nature, you can read about some of the publicly funded research projects [here](/publications/).

__This Blog__: 

My work has gained me expertise in machine learning, big data tools (Spark, Hadoop, cloud computing), surivival modeling, spatio-temporal modeling. While I consider myself knowledgeable, with years of work behind these topics and many more, it was not without an uncountable number of hours of hands-on experience, tutorials, and literature review. I hope that I can share this knowledge with up and coming data scientists to help them in their journey. I say this aknowledging that learning is never done in a field like data science, where the development of techniques and tools is extraordinarily active. So, as I continue to learn, I will also continue to share.
