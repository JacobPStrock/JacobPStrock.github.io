__About Me__:

I began my education and career as a research scientist. It was a job I loved and took me everywhere from research fellowships at NASA and NOAA to leading a research science team through the Arctic on a Swedish icebreaker. While the science was both adventurous and appealing, I found my true love in the quantitative aspects of this work from big-data management to sophisticated statistical and machine learning models. To put it simple: what drew me to data science is the ability to take challenging datasets, inpenetrable without deep statistical understanding and computer science, and turn it into meaningful stories and tools. Coming from a science background where research teams are small, I had an exposure of data from its rawest forms into production models and results worthy of peer-reviewed scientific publication. With a passion for all of it, I decided to dedicate myself 100% to data science.

*The thrill of icebreakers and helicopters is great, but even they pale in comparison to the future I saw in AI.*

With a few years under my belt as a data scientist, and now a M.S. in statistics I have been fortunate to work on everything from decades of environmental time series,  clinical data including several projects with COVID patient data, laboratory based laboratory studies on algae, to performance data from the lithography tools that produce semiconductors. See some of the publications and presentations that have come from [my work](/publications/).

__Nouveaux Neurons__: 

This varied work has gained me expertise in machine learning, big data tools (Spark, Hadoop, cloud computing), surivival modeling, spatio-temporal modeling. While I consider myself knowledgeable, with years of work behind these topics and many more, it was not without an uncountable number of hours of hands-on experience, tutorials, and literature review. I hope that I can share this knowledge with up and coming data scientists to help them in their journey. I say this aknowledging that learning is never done in a field like data science, where the development of techniques and tools is extraordinarily active. So, as I continue to learn, I will also continue to share.
