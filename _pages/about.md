<ins>__This Website__</ins>: 

I decided to build this website as a repository for the varied work I have been a part of. For reasons of confidentiality and data ownership, what is presented on this site can only come from my work in the public sphere. This is largely the work that has been funded by federal grants of some type. All content, and any opinion on this site are soley my own. If the projects on this site interest you, I encourage you to review the peer reviewed publications and presentations which are also linked here and contain more thorough explainations.
