## ðŸ§  Patent: Laser Management Server and Laser Management Method

**Inventors:** Jacob Peter Strock, Yuji Minegishi  
**Submission Date:** February 4, 2025  
**Patent Office:** United States (US)  
**Application Number:** 20250291338

### ðŸ“„ Description
A laser management service for maintenance of lasers used in semiconductor lithography using LLM agents. Together, components enable **autonomous query handling, intelligent response generation, and precise control of laser systems** through integration of agent processing and large language models.

### Abstract
A laser management server for a laser device includes a sending and receiving processor receiving a query from outside; a query input processor receiving and decomposing the query, and generating a first query item requiring external information and a second query item without requiring external information; an agent action processor receiving the first query item, acquiring the required external information from unstructured data and structured data, and generating a first agent response; an equipment agent processor receiving the second query item, receiving the first agent response, and generating a query item prompt related to the second query item; a large language model processor receiving the query item prompt, and generating a query item response; and an equipment control processor receiving a first control signal, and transmitting the first control signal to the laser device. The equipment agent processor receives the query item response and generate the first control signal.
